    <h1 class="n" align = "center"> <b><u>Inheritance in Java</b></u></h1>
    <b>Inheritance in Java</b> is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
    <br> It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).
    <br>
    <br>
    The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class,<br> you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Why use inheritance in java</b>
    <ul>
      <li>For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).</li>
       <li>For Code Reusability.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Terms used in Inheritance</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Class:</b>A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.</li>
      <li><b>Sub Class/Child Class:</b>Subclass is a class which inherits the other class. It is also called a derived class, extended class, or child class.</li>
      <li><b>Super Class/Parent Class:</b>Superclass is the class from where a subclass inherits the features. It is also called a base class or a parent class.</li>
      <li><b>Reusability:</b>As the name specifies, reusability is a mechanism which facilitates you to reuse the fields and methods of the existing class when<br> 
        you create a new class. You can use the same fields and methods already defined in the previous class.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>The syntax of Java Inheritance</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="a"><code>
    class Subclass-name extends Superclass-name<br> 
    {<br>
     //methods and fields<br>  
    }
  </code>
  </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    The <b>extends keyword</b> indicates that you are making a new class that derives from an existing class. The meaning of "extends" is to increase the functionality.
    <br><br>In the terminology of Java, a class which is inherited is called a parent or superclass, and the new class is called child or subclass.<br><br>
    <b>Java Inheritance Example</b>
    <br>
    <img src="1.jpg" height = 200 width = 200 >
    <br>
    <br>
    As displayed in the above figure, Programmer is the subclass and Employee is the superclass. The relationship between the two classes is<b> Programmer IS-A Employee.</b><br> It means that Programmer is a type of Employee.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Example</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="b"><code>
    class Employee{ <br> 
      float salary=40000;<br>  
     }  <br>
     class Programmer extends Employee{  <br>
      int bonus=10000; <br> 
      public static void main(String args[]){  <br>
        Programmer p=new Programmer(); <br> 
        System.out.println("Programmer salary is:"+p.salary); <br> 
        System.out.println("Bonus of Programmer is:"+p.bonus);<br>  
     } <br> 
     }  <br>
    </code>
     </p>
     <br>
     <b>Output</b>
     <br>
     <p class="k">
     Programmer salary is:40000.0<br>
     Bonus of programmer is:10000
    </p>
     <br>
     <br>
     In the above example, Programmer object can access the field of own class as well as of Employee class i.e. code reusability.
